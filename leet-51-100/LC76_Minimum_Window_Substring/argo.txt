Create a charmap of letters that we are looking for in the string to match. Start for loop, where right sets at 0 and continues untill all chars are found. Every time when it is found remove it from charmap and increase size of matches by 1. When matches is equal length of string t you can enter while loop. While loop will start with variable left = 0 (start) and then will rebuild charmap unless matches are reduced to 0. It will break out of while loop and return to for loop with right = end and continue to search for new matches. Then size of matched strings will be compared and smaller one wil be taken. Return the smallest of matched strings.
