Initialize the DP Array as the size of grid to store the valid paths, just loop over the grid, if the grid's current element is obstacle just skip that iteration, and compute the path, before that just initialize the dp[0][1] or dp[1][0] = 1 just because the robot needs to start traveling, and just calculate the current's DP = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1], because it can travel for only 2 directions. At the end all the values are accumulated at the last index in DP, just return that.
