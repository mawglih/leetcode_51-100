Create output array with empty array inside - in any case it will be included. I the first for loop initialize current - pointing to a number. In the second for loop take a slice from output at index j and add current.
Finish building array and return it.

In recursive solution, use builder function to build arrays by pushing into helper array members of nums array, using for loop to move along it.
