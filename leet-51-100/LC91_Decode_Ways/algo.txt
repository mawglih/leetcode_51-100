Check edge cases. Then st 2 temp variables (to save memory space). Start from second digit. If it is not 0 set current equal temp1 tha holds previous results. If slice prev to current  inclusive is valid - add temp2 to current. Save temp1 into temp2 and assign value of current to temp1. In future iterations we will increase temp1 and return it, unless when both if statements do not work and temp1 becoames 0.
