Create two-dimensional array and fill with 0. Create 2 for loops to go thru each member of matrix. If it is row 0 (first row of new array), change values to match what is in matrix. For every other row, if current matrix value is '1' - add 1 to previous cell value ([row - 1][col]) and assign it to current cell value of new array, if '0'  - change value to 0.
Calculate area: for each cell calculate minHeigh (newArr[row][col]). Start another for loop from the end of newArr. If minHeight equal 0 - break from this loop iteration. If current cell value is not 0 and is bigger minHeight, assign it to minHeight. Calculate area and compare to previous maxArea. The bigger wins.
